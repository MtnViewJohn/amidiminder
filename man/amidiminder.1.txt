AMIDIMINDER(1)              General Commands Manual             AMIDIMINDER(1)



NAME
       amidiminder - Utility to manage MIDI device connections

SYNOPSIS
       amidiminder load file
       amidiminder save file
       amidiminder reset
       amidiminder check file


DESCRIPTION
       The amidiminder daemon maintains a set of desired connections (the pro‐
       file) between ALSA sequencer MIDI ports. See amidiminder-daemon(8)  for
       more information.

       A  profile  is a set of rules for connecting MIDI ports between devices
       and/or software. Once a profile is loaded, the daemon will  make  those
       connections  automatically  as the devices are connected to the system,
       and software is started.

       Profiles are written in a simple  rules  syntax.  See  amidiminder-pro‐
       file(5) for the rules format.

       The  daemon  also  observes  connections made by the user (via commands
       such as aconnect(1) ) and from within other software. These are  remem‐
       bered  as a set of observed rules, and these connections are also main‐
       tained.

       These user commands let you manage the profile of connections  used  by
       the daemon.


COMMANDS
   Control commands
       load file
              The  file is first checked for rule syntax, and if it fails, the
              command exits, making no changes.

              If it passes the check, The profile is loaded from the file. Ob‐
              served  rules  are dropped. All existing connections are discon‐
              nected. Then finally, ports are  reconnected  according  to  the
              rules in the newly loaded profile.

              A file name of - (hyphen-minus) loads from the standard input.

       save file
              Write  the  current  profile,  plus  all the observed connection
              rules, to the file.

              A file name of - (hyphen-minus) writes to the standard output.

       reset  Reloads the current profile: Observed rules  are  dropped.   All
              existing  connections  are disconnected. Then finally, ports are
              reconnected according to the rules in the current profile.

   Utility commands
       check file
              Check that the file parses as a valid profile.  Errors  are  re‐
              ported by line.

              A file name of - (hyphen-minus) checks from the standard input.

              The  exit status of the command is 0 if the file is a valid pro‐
              file, and 1 if there are any syntax errors.


ENVIRONMENT
       RUNTIME_DIRECTORY
              The path to the directory that has the UNIX-domain  socket  used
              to communicate between the control commands and the running dae‐
              mon.

              Note: If the system configuration is changed such that the  dae‐
              mon  is  launched with a non-default value for this variable, it
              must also be set the same way when  using  any  of  the  control
              coammands.


FILES
       /run/amidiminder
              The  default  location  of  the  runtime  directory. If the RUN‐
              TIME_DIRECTORY environment variable is not set, this is the path
              used.


       control.socket
              This UNIX-domain socket is located in the runtime directory, and
              is used to communicate between the control commands and the dae‐
              mon.
