# This profile will work if you have some hardware MIDI devices that you
# want to connect all of them to whatever MIDI software you launch.

# If you hardware or software has multiple ports, you may need to write
# more specific rules to achieve the configuration you want.

# You can start with this profile, then connect or disconnect the ports as
# you need, and then use this command to save out a new profile:
#       amidiminder save my-profile.rules

.hw <---> .app
  # Interconnect all hardware and application ports.
  # For simple set ups, this is often all you need.
  # Comment this out if you need to be more explicit about what is connected
  # to what.

RtMidiIn Client <-x- *
RtMidiOut Client -x-> *
  # Don't auto connect anything to these ports. They are generic client
  # names used by various applications, and could mean anything.
