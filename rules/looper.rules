### Looper software rules

# This profile is an example of connecting some hardware MIDI devices
# to a piece of software called "bicycle" (a MIDI looper).

bicycle:control <-- nanoKEY2
bicycle:control <-- Erae Touch
   # These connect my controllers to the software. Sometimes I
   # use the nanoKEY2 keyboard, sometimes I use the Erae surface
   # to play notes. These rules connect both, so which ever is
   # plugged in gets connected.

bicycle:control <-> Launchpad Pro:MIDI
   # Connects the Launchpad to the software, and vice-versa.
   # This allows buttons on the Launchpad to control the
   # software, and the software to control the lights on the
   # Launchpad.
   #
   # The Launchpad presents three MIDI ports, and we want the one
   # that is just plain MIDI from the unit.

bicycle:synth --> MicroMonsta
bicycle:synth --> Hydrasynth
bicycle:synth --> Midihub:1
   # Connects the music output of the software to my synths. The
   # last line connects to a MIDI interface, which has four
   # distinct MIDI outputs, numbered from 0. Here we connect to
   # the second one.

Faderfox --> Midihub:3
   # Lastly, connect a hardware control surface with knobs to the
   # fourth output of the MIDI interface. This is just hardware
   # to hardware connection, used to adjust the parameters of my
   # reverb unit, connected to the MIDI interface.
